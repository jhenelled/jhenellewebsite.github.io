            </h2>

        </p>
        <p> Many people choose one career or job and adhere to it for the rest of their lives. Even though I believe it is truly admirable to have one career, I will not be following that structure for my professional life. Having one career has many benefits
            such as allowing the person to become proficient in their field and giving them stability. Consequently, I understand why many people choose to work towards a career in a particular field. Nonetheless, I am still fascinated with the thought
            of having multiple careers. I am a multi-talented person and I believe that my talent should not be wasted. Additionally, I would love to experience as much as I can and therefore having multiple careers throughout my lifetime would suit me.
            In the future I will be a very successful entrepreneur. My plan is to first become a Data Analyst. Data Analyst typically solve problems by using data that exists. As someone that likes solving technological problems, interest in this career
            was immediate and I know that I could utilize my knowledge and my upcoming skills to become a proficient data analyst. I would also like to have other careers such as becoming a graphic designer, singer/songwriter, and a business owner.

                <center>My Mission Statement</center>
            </h2>
            My mission is to be the best version of myself. As a student that is pursuing a degree in Computing, I will continue taking the necessary steps to prepare for my future careers. The courses I am taking will give me the required knowledge to enter the
            technological field after graduating. I also do personal activities relating to graphic designing, singing/songwriting and take additional online courses outside of school to increase my knowledge. As such, my career goals will be achieved.
