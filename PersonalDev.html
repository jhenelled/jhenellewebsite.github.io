        <h2>My Traits</h2>
        <br/> Here are some of my <b>strengths.</b>

        <br/>One of my biggest strengths is my<mark><tt> Creativity</tt>.</mark>
        <br>

        <img src="../Assets/YouTube.gif" width="500" height="300"></center>
    <center>I write <i>songs, books</i> and do <i>graphic designing </i>in my leisure time.</center><br/>

    <br>I can also be very <mark><tt>persuasive.</tt></mark>
    <br>
    <center><img src="../Assets/meme2.jpg" height="200" width="200"></center><br>

    <br> Another <small>one</small> of my <u>strengths</u> is <b><mark>Critical Thinking</mark></b>. I think about various topics and issues and how they can be solved. I also like knowing the reason behind things.
    </br>

    <p style="color: rgb(87, 21, 126);">In the last<b> 5 years of my life </b>I have been working on my creativity by learning new skills and having fun with it. At first I had no clue how to make a song but now I do. I also mix my own music by adjusting individual tracks and effects to
        produce the final output.</p>
    </br>
    <center><img src="../Assets/goodjob.gif" height="346" width="350"></center>

    <br> Being persuasive is a strength that I have <em>developed by communicating with a lot of people and finding the best way to appeal to their senses.</em> Some people appeal to things at a logical level versus others that are more emotional.</br>
    <br>I believe that my strength of Critical Thinking has slowly been developed throughout my school life and attending utech has helped me to develop this skill more as students have to do their own research and find solutions. Especially with the
    program that I am doing,<tt> Computing is mostly Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.</tt></br>

    <p>In the novel <i></i>"Twelve Pillars</i> written by by Jim Rohn and Chris Widenerwritten there were <big>several lessons taught</big>. Some of these lessons include<b> goal implementation</b>, <em>being careful of the company around you</em> and the
        <em>Proper Use of Time.</em></p>
    <img src="../Assets/time.gif" width="400" height="380">
    <br/>This book encourages people to follow through by making changes in order to become successful people and have the lives they have always wanted.

    <br/><br/> One of the habits that I could develop is <mark>Goal implementation</mark> . This would assist me greatly in my <big>personal development.</big> Specifically, it would mold me into becoming motivated and focused for my future. As a young
    student I currently write down my micro-goals which include monthly assignments. However, I do not have my <sub>short-range</sub>, mid-range or <sup>long-range goals</sup> written down. Starting to write my goals down would be the beginning of my
    personal development journey.
